# XArray 101 🌍
A quick tutorial into data processing with Python (covers the very basics, but is intended to lead you to utilize [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and the [PyData stack](https://pydata.org)). 

> :warning: **As with most things Python this repository stands on the shoulder of giants!** I used, modified and incorporated quite a few tutorial notebooks from various sources (mostly from the original package authors)! In order to streamline the tutorial I include them instead of merely linking them but credits are given in the various notebooks of this repo.   

## Notebooks

### Introduction
Notebooks that get you started with the JupyterLab environment, some basic Python intro (mainly intended for people coming from R), and an introduction to some core libraries from the PyData eocsystem that we will use in this tutorial.

#### Jupyter and Python Basics
* Basic intro
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

#### Xarray Intro
* A first intro to XArray

### More stuff
More advanced notebooks also showing how to work with remote sensing data in Python 
and other tools (i.e. the PyViz toolbox or Intake catalogs).

#### Xarray Advanced
Slicing and dicing...

#### Vector Data
Ditch your ArcGIS and just use python (well, geopandas)

#### Remote Sensing
Reading geotiffs and doing some remote sensing with xarray, rasterio and geopandas

#### Visualization
An intro into the Holoviz/ PyViz ecosystem
